## **Credits**

### **Code used and adapted**

 - The Code Institute's [Boutique Ado](https://github.com/Boiann/boutique_ado) walkthrough project provided a lot of the site's original functionality, direction and design choices that were modified and expanded as needed. It was relied on heavily during whole development process and a lot of code is used directly from it, or with changes/updates to it.

 - [Boudoir Studio](https://boiann.github.io/boudoir-studio/index.html) ( GithHub repository [here](https://github.com/Boiann/boudoir-studio) ) and my previous project gym-pro-fitness. The ReadME file was inspired from my first project [Travel Addict](https://github.com/GeorgeH23/travel-addict/blob/main/README.md) and [Books4Life](https://github.com/tomdu3/books4life/) and [Art-gallery](https://cvek-art-gallery-d4a224801c39.herokuapp.com/)
- All other content was written by the developer

### **Websites visited for info and solutions**
